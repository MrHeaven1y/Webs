# Euler's Circle Visualization

This is a static web application that visualizes Euler's formula, which shows the relationship between trigonometric functions and complex exponentials.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of Euler's formula `e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i·sin(θ)`
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Circle radius
  - Circle opacity
  - Dot opacity
  - Angle
- Rotation controls (clockwise and counter-clockwise)
- MathJax for beautiful mathematical notation

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (desktop recommended)
2. Use the sliders to adjust:
   - Radius: Changes the size of the circle
   - Opacity: Changes the transparency of the circle
   - Dot Opacity: Changes the transparency of the red dot
   - Angle: Changes the position of the dot on the circle
3. Use the rotation controls to animate the movement:
   - "Rotate" button: Rotates the dot clockwise
   - "Counter Clockwise" button: Rotates the dot counter-clockwise
4. Click the "Explanation" button for a brief explanation of Euler's formula
